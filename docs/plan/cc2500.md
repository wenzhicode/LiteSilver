### cc2500

1、使用SPI_RX

- This has a number of advantages
  - the RX can be directly added to the flight controller board, allowing for smaller builds (after all, not many people want to use a flight controller *without* an RX);
  - it does not require one or more extra UARTs on the flight controller, and there is no risk of problems caused by a wrong UART configuration;
  - it does not require an extra MCU to control the radio chip, and can therefore be produced / sold cheaper;
  - since the RX 'firmware' is part of the flight controller firmware, fixes and updates will be applied as part of flight controller firmware updates, eliminating the need for (often cumbersome) RX firmware updates.
- there are also disadvantages
  - a flight controller board will only have one radio chip, and will only be able to support the RC protocols that are using this chip
